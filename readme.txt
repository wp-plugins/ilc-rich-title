ILC Rich Title
http://ilovecolors.com.ar

This plugin will enable the TinyMCE rich text editor for the title field when writing a page or post. Requires jQuery to work, but rather than including it with <script>, the plugin will enqueue the jQuery library included with WordPress using wp_enqueue_script on the admin area.

There are a couple of style to remove the margin between the title label and the TinyMCE editor area, and the padding around the title box and the border.

Beware, for this plugin will paragraphise all your titles, so what once was a h3 headline in your styles now might be h3 p.
