ILC Rich Title
http://ilovecolors.com.ar

This plugin will enable the TinyMCE rich text editor for the title field
when writing a page or post. Requires jQuery to work, but rather than
including it with <script>, the plugin will enqueue the jQuery library
included with WordPress using wp_enqueue_script on the admin area.

There are a couple of style to remove the margin between the title
label and the TinyMCE editor area, and the padding around the title
box and the border.

Beware, for this plugin will paragraphise all your titles, so what
once was a h3 headline in your styles now might be h3 p.
